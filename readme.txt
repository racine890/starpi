Welcome to Starpi V2 !
This is a Moc, a tool for developpers that can help replace a distant server while programming using APIS. Front-end devs can use it to simulate backend data while backend developper can use it to simulate external resource when it's unaivalable
( eg : You have to use a payment api for your app but it's not available right now, then you can use Starpi to fake it ).
The advantages of using starpi instead of in-code moc is that it stays and is managed externally, to provide a better simulation.
Starpi uses its own server too, which allows to serve responses for multiple users on the same network. Starpi will just answer as long as the query matches the endpoint, which means that it will not check any security header.
That means that you don't have to change anything to your code but the base endpoint url, and it's all working!
NB: Please, Starpi responses are public, so don't use any private or sensitive data there!
